# Golang Job Scraper
Simple scraper that keeps my email updated with the latest jobs from Upwork and WeLoveGolang

## To-Do's
- [ ] Integrate into Facebook bot messenger (Future)
- [ ] Separate Upwork and WLG into plugin structure that obey interfaces.
- [ ] Move all "system" login into single folder with structure: ```
    {
      job-scraper: {
        scraper: {
          plugins: {
          },
          model: {
          },
          email: {
          },
          db: {
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
